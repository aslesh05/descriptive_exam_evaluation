What is the Meaning of Artifical Intelligence?

Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. 
Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.


What is the Meaning of machine Learning?

What is machine learning? Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.
 Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.


Why is it called deep learning?

Deep Learning gets its name from the fact that we add more "Layers" to learn from the data. 
If you don't already know, when a deep learning model learns, it just changes the weights using an optimization function. 
A Layer is a row of so-called "Neurons" in the middle.

What is the difference between learning and deep learning?

Machine learning and deep learning are both types of AI. In short, machine learning is AI that can automatically adapt with minimal human interference. 
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning process of the human brain.


What is data science in simple words?

Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), 
and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization's data. 
These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.
